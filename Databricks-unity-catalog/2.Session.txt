How to configure the metastore in Unity Catalog

two step process

Step 1 : configure storage for your metastore

table is made of - data and metadata


1. created storage account - adls gen2

This storage will keep the metadata related to unity catalog metastore and 
the objects inside it.

for the managed tables this will keep the data also.

Storage account name -  unitycatalogsa


2. create a storage container that will hold your unity catalog metastores metadata
   and managed data.

container - unityroot


3. In Azure, create a databricks access connector that holds a managed identity 
   and give it access to the storage container.

=> created databricks access container - ttdatabricksaccesscon


go to storage account

and click on access control(IAM) 

Add -> Add role assignment

role -> storage blob data contributor

assign access to -> managed identity

select member -> select accordingly

we are giving access to above created connector.

-------------------------------------------------------

Step 2 : you will go to your databricks UI and there we will create the metastore.
	 we can link multiple workspaces to this metastore.


create a azure databricks workspace	

requirement while creating the workspace

unity catalog needs the pricing tier as - Premium(role based access controls)


created a premium databricks workspace 	- ttdatabricks101ws


created one more databrick workspace - standard one



log in to workspace as an account admin

clicked on data icon

click on create metastore -

-> region should be the same where you have the storage account and the workspaces.

-> path of storage account

-> access connector id 


we attached the premium workspace with this metastore.
