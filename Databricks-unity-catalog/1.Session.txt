Unity Catalog
==============


Session 1 
==========

Unity catalog is a unified data governance solution for all the data assets in the
lakehouse.

Data governance means setting data policies.

tables  (Database objects)
users   (100 users)
access policies


Basically we have objects and users and we grant permision to users on various objects

All of this is centralized and not just limited to individual workspaces.


key features of unity catalog :
===============================

=> unity catalog allows you to create a centralized metadata layer.
   so our databases, tables and views can be shared across multiple workspaces.

=> unity catalog security model is based on Standard ANSI SQL and allows 
   admins to grant permission in their existing datalake using familiar sql syntax.

=> Provides built in Auditing - captures user level audit logs.
   
unity catalog captures and audit log of actions performed against the metastore.

This enables admins to access fine-grained details about who accessed a given 
dataset and what actions they performed.




It offers more feature such as :
=================================

Delta sharing
Data lineage
Data discovery


Delta sharing :
===============

you can easily share existing data in delta lake and parquet formats to any
computing platform.

It can be done is a very secure manner.

Delta Sharing is an open protocol developed by Databricks for secure data sharing 
with other organizations regardless of the computing platforms they use.



Data lineage : we can track how this data has come.
=============


t1

        t3 (sales)

t2


Data discovery :
================

A open search capabality and we can search for anything there.



Summary :
==========


Metastore - tables, views

user management - users

Access controls


Multiple databricks workspaces are linked as it is centralized

Withount unity catalog, your metastore, user management and access control are
defined at the workspace level. Data objects such as databases and tables 
which are created in one workspace will not be visible in other workspace.
